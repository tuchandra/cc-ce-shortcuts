# cc-ce-shortcuts
Register keyboard shortcuts for using the ClickCritters Click Exchange.

**Last updated: April 30, 2020** to version 1.1. If you are using an older version, you'll have to remove the current version and reload this one using the steps below.

## Overview
[Click Critters](https://www.clickcritters.com) is a virtual adoptable site where users can collect adoptables and play many games. One feature on the site is the 'Click Exchange', where one can level up their own and other players' adoptables. You repeatedly answer questions by choosing between two adoptables, left or right; this Chrome extension registers `j` and `k` as shortcuts for clicking on the left and right adoptables, respectively. It also registers `i` as a shortcut for the 'back' button on an incorrect answer.

## Installation
Until this is available on the Chrome Web Store, you can install this yourself fairly easily. Follow these steps:

1. Download all of these files by clicking **Clone or Download**, a green button near the top-right corner of the list of files. Choose "Download ZIP."
2. Unzip the folder into a new folder on your computer. Name it whatever you want, but "cc-ce-shortcuts" is a reasonable idea.
3. In Chrome, go to the top right and click on the 3-dots menu. Go to **More tools > Extensions**.
4. Check the **Developer Mode** checkbox on that page.
5. Click the **Load unpacked extension...** button on that page.
6. Select the folder you just created.
7. Make sure the **Enabled** checkbox is checked.

The extension should now run on the Light CE.
